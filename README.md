# Ocean Autopilot Initiative ðŸ¤–
[A2RL](https://a2rl.io/) is the first autonomous racing league that brings technology and speed in a competition where 8 different AI-powered vehicles compete against each others. 

Ocean Protocol Foundation sees an opportunity to leverage its existing Data Challenges program to build a crowd-sourced metamodel for autonomous racing sports. The driver behind this initiaitve is to utilize & promote the use of our technology within the automotive industry, but also to collect & make valuable datapoints available for research purposes whilst strenghening the ties with our partner Mercedes-Benz

## Execution Plan

- Data challenges to announce a new initiatve focused on Autonomous Racing, particularly around Deep Learning models
  
- This initiative will be initially supported by Ocean Protocol Foundation - particularly by Stream 2 - with the goal to become a standalone, independent initiative that uses the Ocean stack and promote visibility to Ocean Protocol Foundation and its ecosystem.

- This initiative should eventually sustains itself via sponsorships, donations and revenues generated by monetizing the hundreds of GB of data collected on track.

- Ocean Protocol Foundation will do the first heavy lifting by creating a collaborative framework to allow crowdsourcing of Autonomous Racing models from its data science community. This will mostly be supported through internal efforts as well as by establishing at least 7 Sprints, each focusing on targeted areaas. This structure should allow for new participants to enter the challenge at any time and eventually attract more & more universities as well.

- Ocean Protocol Foundation to propose a partnership to its collaborator Acentrik - whos' sponsored by Mercedes Benz Singapore - to form the first Web3 Racing Team and compete in the 2025 A2RL championship

- Ocean Protocol Foundation to eventually establish a RacingDAO with the goal to democratize access to racing sports and allow more AI talents to join the program, contribute to research and possibly govern the model.
