# Ocean Racing Team ðŸ¤–
[A2RL](https://a2rl.io/) is the first autonomous racing league that brings technology and speed in a competition where 8 different AI-powered vehicles compete against each others. 

Ocean Protocol sees an opportunity to leverage its existing Data Challenges program to build a crowd-sourced metamodel for autonomous racing sports. The driver behind this initiaitve is to utilize & promote the use of our technology within the automotive industry, but also to collect & make valuable datapoints available for research purposes whilst strenghening the ties with our partner Mercedes-Benz

#### VEHICLE INFORMATION
These combustion engine supercars use a [Dallara](https://www.dallara.it/en) chasis and are equipped with 7x Sony IMX728 360Â°coverage cameras, 4x ZF ProWave Radars, 3x Seyond Falcon Kinetic FK1 Lidars, 1x Neousys RGS-8805GC Computer - collecting approximately 5 GB of data per second.

## Execution Plan

- Data challenges to announce a new initiatve XYZ focused on Autonomous Racing, particularly around Deep Learning models
  
- XYZ will be initially supported by OPF as part of S2 efforts with the goal to become a standalone, independent initiative that uses the Ocean stack and sustains itself via sponsorships, donations and revenues generated by monetizing the hundreds of GB of data collected on track.

- OPF will do the first heavy lifting by creating a collaborative framework around this, establishing sprints to break down the problem into smaller ones, promote the initiative to partners and collaborators, attract interest from the community, engage with universities and A2RL regulators and more.

- OPF to partner with Acentrik, sponsored by Mercedes, to form the first Web3 Racing team and Race in the 2025 A2RL championship

- OPF to eventually establish a RacingDAO with the goal to democratize access to racing sports and allow more AI talents to join the program, contribute to research and possibly govern the model.
