## Overview

In a racing environment, teams continuously collect and analyze data to make better decisions and outcompete their rivals. Most data collected is proprietary, and understandably, there is no incentive to share such information with other teams.

However, the nature of the race dictates that the winner is the team that outperforms the others, not necessarily the fastest one. Victory depends on being better compared to the competition.

This means that speed, downforce, and grip must always be evaluated in comparison to other teams. Whether the average speed of all teams is 200 km/h or 30 km/h, the goal remains to perform better than the rest. What matters more is not how fast you go, but how much faster you are than your competitors.

## Why Distributed Analytics

Understanding a team's progress relative to other teams can help answer questions like "Am I working on the right components?" or "Am I improving this metric enough to outperform the other teams?" Just as benchmarking is used for lap times, where the data is made publicly available, so too can benchmarking be used for private data such as aerodynamics, and GPU.

This is where accessing more analytics—particularly an anonymized, aggregated means of private data—becomes valuable. It allows each team to analyze and compare their own private datapoints with the average progress across all teams.
